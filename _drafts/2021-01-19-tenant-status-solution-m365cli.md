Are you an IT Pro who wants to have a solution which checks the status of your Microsoft 365 Tenant. You can always get the status of Microsoft 365 status, whether everything is going smooth or are there any outages going on currently. 


How about if you get notified when something goes wrong in your tenant and you gets that information before your users complain. Awesome, right?
