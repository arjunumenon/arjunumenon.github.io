I am Arjun U Menon. I work as a Technical Lead for an IT Services company based out of India. A person who started loving the cloud right at the moment when it came into the picture. Always been a fan of Microsoft stack and now exploring the beauty of the mighty Microsoft 365.
I like to call myself a consultant. Love to give solutions to the client who wants to be lazy like me. Wants to make things happen with the least number of steps. Those are the people who I love most and I thrive to make their life easier.
I live in India where the diversities are part and parcel of the entire country and have been loving just because of that.

Off late I started contributing to the mighty Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices Community. Thought I started contributing to the community a year and a half back, it is off late, I started loving it. Needless to say, there was no looking back. I had been a big fan of [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/cli-m365){:target="_blank"} right from the beginning and no wonder I started contributing to that.

Beginning of February 2021, I was fortunate enough to be included as [one of the maintainers of the amazing CLI for Microsoft 365](https://twitter.com/arjunumenon/status/1356632358879813640){:target="_blank"} beginning of February 2021. One of the best news of 2021.

Had been part of [The Toastmasters Club](https://www.toastmasters.org/){:target="_blank"} for more than 3 years. But currently in a break from the amazing journey.

When I am not delved in the technical zone, you can see me indulged in food or kindling eagerly through my Amazon Kindle ðŸ“”.

Have a pleasant stay while you **Live Inside the Cloud**. Feel free to connect me via any of the below social media handles.
